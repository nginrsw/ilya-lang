Irina Ilyukhina Programming Language is a personal fork of Lua, modified
slightly to make it easier for me to learn, write, and personalize.

The only changes from the original Lua are:

- The reserved word `local` has been replaced with `locked`.
- The reserved word `function` has been replaced with `fn`.

Everything else remains the same as in the original Lua language.
